Description:

In this programming assignment you will need to analyze some allocated memory. To do this, you will use a variety of the your knowledge gained in the module in addition to any of the GCC tools.

After completing this assignment, you will be able to:

    Use GCC Binary Utilities to investigate the memory usage of an executable
    Investigate the map file for the memory usage of an executable
    Determine where compiled code and data symbols are allocated, the lifetime of these symbols and the access restrictions

Instructions:

You will use the GCC toolchain to help understand how your code and data are allocated in your memory space. To test your makefile you will need to download the assessments files for Course 1 from the github page. You can git clone the assessments repo from github:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/afosdick/ese-coursera-course1.git
```

The folder contains 4 files:

    main.c - Main file you are to work with
    misc.c - File that declares some data and defines some functions
    misc.h - File that contains function declarations and macros
    msp432p401r.lds - Linker file for the msp432

Given the code and linker file provided from the zip file, you will need to specify where the listed symbols will be placed in our program.Once you have figured out your memory space, you can take the Programming Assignment Quiz where you will provide details about specific symbol elements including:

    Location Top segment or Type - Code, Data, Peripheral, Register, None
    Location Sub-segment - Stack, Heap, BSS, Data, const/rodata, None
    Access Permissions - Read (R), Write (W) Read-write (RW), None
    Lifetime - Function/Block, Program, Indefinite, None

Once you have passed the Programming Assignment Quiz, a solution table will become available to you so that you may review your responses and reflect on any incorrect answers.
Suggestions:

There are multiple suggestions of tools you can use to help determine these answers besides just inspection.

    You may generate a .map file using the linker flag -Wl,-Map=main.map

    With this file you can look find certain assignments listed in the code.

2. You can use the GCC binary utility nm to investigate the code symbols

    This will print code/data symbols with the memory properties

3. You can use the GCC toolchain and dump a file to assembly with the -S option.

    This will provide some details on how a piece of data is allocated

4. You can add code to this to investigate the addresses that have been assigned to the variables and print those to the terminal
